A Fragment is a piece of an activity which enable more modular activity design. It will not be wrong if we say, a fragment is a kind of sub-activity.
Following are important points about fragment âˆ’

A fragment has its own layout and its own behaviour with its own life cycle callbacks.

You can add or remove fragments in an activity while the activity is running.

You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI.

A fragment can be used in multiple activities.

Fragment life cycle is closely related to the life cycle of its host activity which means when the activity is paused, all the fragments available in the activity will also be stopped.

A fragment can implement a behaviour that has no user interface component.

Fragments were added to the Android API in Honeycomb version of Android which API version 11.

You create fragments by extending Fragment class and You can insert a fragment into your activity layout by declaring the fragment in the activity's layout file, as a <fragment> element.

Prior to fragment introduction, we had a limitation because we can show only a single activity on the screen at one given point in time. So we were not able to divide device screen and control different parts separately. But with the introduction of fragment we got more flexibility and removed the limitation of having a single activity on the screen at a time. Now we can have a single activity but each activity can comprise of multiple fragments which will have their own layout, events and complete life cycle.
